# DSBSC-USING-PYTHON
# Aim
To implement and analyze DSBSC using Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.
# EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED
Software: Python with NumPy and Matplotlib libraries
Hardware: Personal Computer
# Algorithm:
1.Initialize Parameters: Set the values for carrier frequency, message frequency, sampling frequency, and frequency deviation.

2.Generate Time Axis: Create a time vector for the signal duration.

3.Generate Message Signal: Define the message signal as a cosine wave.

4.Compute the Integral of the Message Signal: Calculate the integral of the message signal over time.

5.Generate DSBSC Signal: Apply the DSBSC formula to obtain the modulated signal.

6.Plot the Signals: Use Matplotlib to plot the message signal, carrier signal, and modulated signal.
